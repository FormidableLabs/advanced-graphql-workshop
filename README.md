This project is set up so you can see your GraphQL client working witin a ready made project. If you get stuck, fall behind or just want to see the ready solution at any point of the workshop, we've broken all the code into branches that will act as a "checkpoints" as the workshop progresses. Branch name should give you idea of where you're about to `checkout` into.
